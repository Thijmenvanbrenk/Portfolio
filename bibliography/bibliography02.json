  {"id":"stroblPositiveCorrelationPesticide2020","abstract":"Simple Summary\nThe possible impacts of neonicotinoids combined with glyphosate-based herbicides on bees are unknown. Here, we show no effects of chronic exposure to field-realistic dosages of Roundup® and clothianidin alone or combined on food consumption and cumulative survival of adult female bees, Osmia bicornis in the laboratory. However, a positive correlation between exposure and longevity was revealed. Our data suggest a possibly neglected trade-off between survival and reproduction in insect toxicology.\n\nAbstract\nThe ubiquitous use of pesticides is one major driver for the current loss of biodiversity, and the common practice of simultaneously applying multiple agrochemicals may further contribute. Insect toxicology currently has a strong focus on survival to determine the potential hazards of a chemical routinely used in risk evaluations. However, studies revealing no effect on survival or even indicating enhanced survival are likely to be misleading, if potential trade-offs between survival and other physiological factors are overlooked. Here, we used standard laboratory experiments to investigate the sublethal (i.e., food consumption) and lethal (i.e., survival) effects of two common agricultural pesticides (Roundup® and clothianidin) on adult female solitary bees, Osmia bicornis. The data showed no significant effect of the treatment on cumulative survival; however, a significant positive correlation between herbicide and insecticide exposure and age was revealed, i.e., bees exposed to higher dosages lived longer. As no significant differences in daily food consumption were observed across treatment groups, increased food intake can be excluded as a factor leading to the prolonged survival. While this study does not provide data on fitness effects, two previous studies using solitary bees observed significant negative effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on fitness, yet not on survival. Thus, we conjecture that the observed non-significant effects on longevity may result from a trade-off between survival and reproduction. The data suggest that a focus on survival can lead to false-negative results and it appears inevitable to include fitness or at least tokens of fitness at the earliest stage in future risk assessments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Strobl","given":"Verena"},{"family":"Camenzind","given":"Domenic"},{"family":"Minnameyer","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Eyer","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Neumann","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Straub","given":"Lars"}],"citation-key":"stroblPositiveCorrelationPesticide2020","container-title":"Insects","container-title-short":"Insects","DOI":"10.3390/insects11110819","ISSN":"2075-4450","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,20]]},"page":"819","PMCID":"PMC7699727","PMID":"33233695","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Positive Correlation between Pesticide Consumption and Longevity in Solitary Bees: Are We Overlooking Fitness Trade-Offs?","title-short":"Positive Correlation between Pesticide Consumption and Longevity in Solitary Bees","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7699727/","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"vandervoetReportingGuidelineDevelopmental2021","abstract":"Implementation of reliable methodologies allowing Reduction, Refinement, and Replacement (3Rs) of animal testing is a process that takes several decades and is still not complete. Reliable methods are essential for regulatory hazard assessment of chemicals where differences in test protocol can influence the test outcomes and thus affect the confidence in the predictive value of the organisms used as an alternative for mammals. Although test guidelines are common for mammalian studies, they are scarce for non-vertebrate organisms that would allow for the 3Rs of animal testing., Here, we present a set of 30 reporting criteria as the basis for such a guideline for Developmental and Reproductive Toxicology (DART) testing in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Small organisms like C. elegans are upcoming in new approach methodologies for hazard assessment; thus, reliable and robust test protocols are urgently needed. A literature assessment of the fulfilment of the reporting criteria demonstrates that although studies describe methodological details, essential information such as compound purity and lot/batch number or type of container is often not reported. The formulated set of reporting criteria for C. elegans testing can be used by (i) researchers to describe essential experimental details (ii) data scientists that aggregate information to assess data quality and include data in aggregated databases (iii) regulators to assess study data for inclusion in regulatory hazard assessment of chemicals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Voet","given":"Monique","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Teunis","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Louter-van de Haar","given":"Johanna"},{"family":"Stigter","given":"Nienke"},{"family":"Bhalla","given":"Diksha"},{"family":"Rooseboom","given":"Martijn"},{"family":"Wever","given":"Kimberley E"},{"family":"Krul","given":"Cyrille"},{"family":"Pieters","given":"Raymond"},{"family":"Wildwater","given":"Marjolein"},{"family":"Noort","given":"Vera","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"vandervoetReportingGuidelineDevelopmental2021","container-title":"Toxicology Research","container-title-short":"Toxicol Res (Camb)","DOI":"10.1093/toxres/tfab109","ISSN":"2045-452X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,28]]},"page":"1202-1210","PMCID":"PMC8692742","PMID":"34950447","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Towards a reporting guideline for developmental and reproductive toxicology testing in C. elegans and other nematodes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8692742/","volume":"10"}
