  abstract = {Simple Summary The possible impacts of neonicotinoids combined with glyphosate-based herbicides on bees are unknown. Here, we show no effects of chronic exposure to field-realistic dosages of Roundup\textregistered{} and clothianidin alone or combined on food consumption and cumulative survival of adult female bees, Osmia bicornis in the laboratory. However, a positive correlation between exposure and longevity was revealed. Our data suggest a possibly neglected trade-off between survival and reproduction in insect toxicology. Abstract The ubiquitous use of pesticides is one major driver for the current loss of biodiversity, and the common practice of simultaneously applying multiple agrochemicals may further contribute. Insect toxicology currently has a strong focus on survival to determine the potential hazards of a chemical routinely used in risk evaluations. However, studies revealing no effect on survival or even indicating enhanced survival are likely to be misleading, if potential trade-offs between survival and other physiological factors are overlooked. Here, we used standard laboratory experiments to investigate the sublethal (i.e., food consumption) and lethal (i.e., survival) effects of two common agricultural pesticides (Roundup\textregistered{} and clothianidin) on adult female solitary bees, Osmia bicornis. The data showed no significant effect of the treatment on cumulative survival; however, a significant positive correlation between herbicide and insecticide exposure and age was revealed, i.e., bees exposed to higher dosages lived longer. As no significant differences in daily food consumption were observed across treatment groups, increased food intake can be excluded as a factor leading to the prolonged survival. While this study does not provide data on fitness effects, two previous studies using solitary bees observed significant negative effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on fitness, yet not on survival. Thus, we conjecture that the observed non-significant effects on longevity may result from a trade-off between survival and reproduction. The data suggest that a focus on survival can lead to false-negative results and it appears inevitable to include fitness or at least tokens of fitness at the earliest stage in future risk assessments.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Neuroblastoma displays important clinical and genetic heterogeneity, with emergence of new mutations at tumor progression.Experimental Design: To study clonal evolution during treatment and follow-up, an innovative method based on circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis by whole-exome sequencing (WES) paired with target sequencing was realized in sequential liquid biopsy samples of 19 neuroblastoma patients.Results: WES of the primary tumor and cfDNA at diagnosis showed overlap of single-nucleotide variants (SNV) and copy number alterations, with 41\% and 93\% of all detected alterations common to the primary neuroblastoma and cfDNA. CfDNA WES at a second time point indicated a mean of 22 new SNVs for patients with progressive disease. Relapse-specific alterations included genes of the MAPK pathway and targeted the protein kinase A signaling pathway. Deep coverage target sequencing of intermediate time points during treatment and follow-up identified distinct subclones. For 17 seemingly relapse-specific SNVs detected by cfDNA WES at relapse but not tumor or cfDNA WES at diagnosis, deep coverage target sequencing detected these alterations in minor subclones, with relapse-emerging SNVs targeting genes of neuritogenesis and cell cycle. Furthermore a persisting, resistant clone with concomitant disappearance of other clones was identified by a mutation in the ubiquitin protein ligase HERC2.Conclusions: Modelization of mutated allele fractions in cfDNA indicated distinct patterns of clonal evolution, with either a minor, treatment-resistant clone expanding to a major clone at relapse, or minor clones collaborating toward tumor progression. Identification of treatment-resistant clones will enable development of more efficient treatment strategies. Clin Cancer Res; 24(4); 939\textendash 49. \textcopyright 2017 AACR.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Copy-number analysis to detect disease-causing losses and gains across the genome is recommended for the evaluation of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders and/or multiple congenital anomalies, as well as for fetuses with ultrasound abnormalities. In the decade that this analysis has been in widespread clinical use, tremendous strides have been made in understanding the effects of copy-number variants (CNVs) in both affected individuals and the general population. However, continued broad implementation of array and next-generation sequencing-based technologies will expand the types of CNVs encountered in the clinical setting, as well as our understanding of their impact on human health. METHODS: To assist clinical laboratories in the classification and reporting of CNVs, irrespective of the technology used to identify them, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics has developed the following professional standards in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) project. RESULTS: This update introduces a quantitative, evidence-based scoring framework; encourages the implementation of the five-tier classification system widely used in sequence variant classification; and recommends "uncoupling" the evidence-based classification of a variant from its potential implications for a particular individual. CONCLUSION: These professional standards will guide the evaluation of constitutional CNVs and encourage consistency and transparency across clinical laboratories.},

  abstract = {Differences between genomes can be due to single nucleotide variants, translocations, inversions, and copy number variants (CNVs, gain or loss of DNA). The latter can range from sub-microscopic events to complete chromosomal aneuploidies. Small CNVs are often benign but those larger than 500\,kb are strongly associated with morbid consequences such as developmental disorders and cancer. Detecting CNVs within and between populations is essential to better understand the plasticity of our genome and to elucidate its possible contribution to disease. Hence there is a need for better-tailored and more robust tools for the detection and genome-wide analyses of CNVs. While a link between a given CNV and a disease may have often been established, the relative CNV contribution to disease progression and impact on drug response is not necessarily understood. In this review we discuss the progress, challenges, and limitations that occur at different stages of CNV analysis from the detection (using DNA microarrays and next-generation sequencing) and identification of recurrent CNVs to the association with phenotypes. We emphasize the importance of germline CNVs and propose strategies to aid clinicians to better interpret structural variations and assess their clinical implications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paediatric tumours are often characterised by the presence of recurrent DNA copy number alterations (CNAs). These DNA copy number profiles, obtained from a tissue biopsy, can aid in the correct prognostic classification and therapeutic stratification of several paediatric cancer entities (e.g. MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma) and are part of the routine diagnostic practice. Liquid biopsies (LQBs) offer a potentially safer alternative for such invasive tumour tissue biopsies and can provide deeper insight into tumour heterogeneity. PROCEDURE: The robustness and reliability of LQB CNA analyses was evaluated. We performed retrospective CNA profiling using shallow whole-genome sequencing (sWGS) on paired plasma circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and tissue DNA samples from routinely collected samples from paediatric patients (n~=~128) representing different tumour entities, including osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms tumour, brain tumours and neuroblastoma. RESULTS: Overall, we observed a good concordance between CNAs in tissue DNA and cfDNA. The main cause of CNA discordance was found to be low cfDNA sample quality (i.e. the ratio of cfDNA ({$<$}700 bp) and high molecular weight DNA ({$>$}700 bp)). Furthermore, CNAs were observed that were present in cfDNA and not in tissue DNA, or vice-versa. In neuroblastoma samples, no false-positives or false-negatives were identified for the detection of the prognostic marker MYCN amplification. CONCLUSION: In future prospective studies, CNA analysis on LQBs that are of sufficient quality can serve as a complementary assay for CNA analysis on tissue biopsies, as either cfDNA or tissue DNA can contain CNAs that cannot be identified in the other biomaterial.},
