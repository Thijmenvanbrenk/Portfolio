(for example, group1 would consist of 2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene with a concentration of 4.99 nM, etc.) 2. checking normality for every condition. NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED DATA: 3. perform ANOVA. with post-hoc tests and check if they differ from the control. NOT NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED DATA: 3. perform kruskal - wallis test. 4. to visualize this difference, make a smoothed line graph for every the mean of every concentration per substance. 5. compare these graphs with each other. normalized_value &lt;- offspring_tidy %&gt;% group_by(compName) %&gt;% filter(compName == &quot;S-medium&quot;) %&gt;% summarise(mean = mean(RawData, na.rm = T)) offspring_tidy &lt;- offspring_tidy %&gt;% mutate(normalized_offspring = RawData/normalized_value$mean) offspring_tidy %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = log10(compConcentration + 0.0001), y = normalized_offspring)) + geom_jitter(aes(shape = expType, colour = compName), width = .1) + labs(title = &quot;Amount of offspring from C. elegans incubated in different substances&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Experiment data from (van der Voet et al. 2021)&quot;, x = &quot;Log 10 of compound concentration&quot;, y = &quot;Normalized offspring amount by mean of negative control&quot;, colour = &quot;Compound name&quot;, shape = &quot;Experiment type&quot;) + scale_shape_discrete(labels = c(&quot;Negative control&quot;, &quot;Positive control&quot;, &quot;Vehicle A control&quot;, &quot;Experiment&quot;)) + scale_colour_brewer(palette = &quot;Dark2&quot;) + theme_classic() We normalize the data so we can see the difference between the different substances more easily. in this assignment, this study [@stroblPositiveCorrelationPesticide2020] will be graded on the criteria for reproducibility. 1.10.1 introduction to this article the use of pesticides is one of the main reasons of loss of biodiversity, and the combination of multiple pesticides could even make this worse. in this experiment it is investigated what the sublethal (food consumption) and the lethal (survival) effects of pesticides are on adult female solitary bees, Osmia bicornis. to perform these tests, female solitary bees were divided into 4 groups: pesticide free (control) herbicide pesticide combined (both herbicide and pesticide) their consumption rate and longevity were measured and the data from these two variables are used for analysis. their is no significant difference in survival and consumption between te different groups. there is however a significant positive correlation between the consumption rate and the longevity of these bees. 1.10.2 grading of this experiment on the transparancy criteria transparancycriteria grading study purpose TRUE dataavailability FALSEonly part of the data isavailable data location at the beginning/at the end studylocation TRUEmaterials/methods authorreview location and emailare present at the top ethicsstatement FALSE fundingstatement TRUE codeavailability TRUE The part of the data that is available can be accessed through this directory: data/insects-957898-supplementary.xlsx 1.10.3 my file structure to show my ability at organizing files heres an example of the file structure from one of my previous projects d "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
